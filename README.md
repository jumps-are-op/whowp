# whowp *the better whow*. (kind of)

This a rewrite (mostly) of
[whow](https://github.com/daringcuteseal/whow)
the main differences are

* Configs are now only 2 files
* new schedule subcommands `add` and `del`,
	which works same as events' `add` and `del`

## To-Do's (How Ironic)
- [X] ~~Fix coloring of events/schedules/to-dos when important and a tag
	without any colors~~  
- [X] ~~Fix schedules displaying~~  
- [X] ~~Make a devlog-like blog about this shit~~
